# BMI_calculator
BMI calculator app for Android course

Requirements:
The application should:
• Calculate BMI using both metric and imperial units (switching between units should clear the currently entered values).
• The calculated BMI value should change color based on the BMI category range (the color should not change when the screen is rotated).
• History screen: Display a list of the 10 most recent measurements (date, weight, height, and BMI), which can be saved using SharedPreferences.
• Display a description that defines the BMI data, e.g., obesity.
• About the author/creator page (e.g., photo/avatar, name, and description about me).
